# PROMUEVA DATA

This repository contains a collection of anonymized datasets gathered from X (formerly Twitter) and YouTube as part of the [PROMUEVA Project](https://sites.google.com/view/promueva/english-version). We collected and analyzed around 133,000 social media posts (mainly on X/Twitter, with one major case on YouTube) covering ten salient topics in Colombia between June 2024 and June 2025. The distribution of posts is:


| Topic                                      | Volume | Platform |
|--------------------------------------------|---------|-----------|
| Pension Reform                             | 10,000  | X         |
| COP16 Biodiversity Conference              | 10,000  | X         |
| Pegasus (surveillance software)            | 5,000   | X         |
| Deportados (deportations to Colombia)      | 10,000  | X         |
| Álvaro Uribe Trial                         | 73,000  | YouTube   |
| Gender Violence     (Univalle case)        | 1,000   | X         |
| Gender Violence     (general)              | 7,000   | X         |
| Gustavo Petro visit to Cali                | 4,500   | X         |
| Labor Referendum (labor reform)            | 5,000   | X         |
| Miguel Uribe Attempt                       | 7,500   | X         |

For each case, we combined qualitative contextualization with quantitative measures of audience stance and polarization using the MEC (Mass Event Consensus) index. Results show strong contrasts: while environmental and gender-violence debates exhibit low or very low polarization, institutional reforms such as the pension reform (MEC 0.626) and the labor reform referendum (MEC 0.505) trigger very high polarization. The Uribe trial stands out with the highest volume of interactions (73,000 posts) but relatively low polarization, indicating that salience and divisiveness do not always coincide.

This datasets illustrates how different issues mobilize publics in distinct ways, providing empirical grounding for models of opinion dynamics and polarization. It is directly relevant to interdisciplinary research in computer science, political science, and social sciences, offering a testbed for validating theoretical models of bias, consensus, and polarization against real-world data.
